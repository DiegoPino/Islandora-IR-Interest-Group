## Notes
* New member: John O'Connor!
  * eScholarship Repository Librarian (the new Emily Toner) at Boston College
  * Will be attending Islandora Camp
  * Only been in current position for ~3ish weeks so still learning about Islandora & Scholar
* Discussion of ISLANDORA-1837
  * Seems like making the Solr fields used to link People to their works as a variable configurable in the admin menu (defaulting to the current hardcoded value) is a sane solution that shouldn't be too difficult to implement
  * Bryan will discuss this with Rosie Le Faive (Entities component manager)
* Discussion of UTK's TRACE IR migration project
  * Undergoing usability testing
  * Encountering issues with embargoes and role access
  * How to handle "withdrawn" ETDs?
    * FSU implements an object-level embargo, but no tombstones
    * Other members agree that tombstones are a good idea, especially if you have permalinks/DOIs
* Discussion of new Islandora contrib modules: Islandora Badges and Islandora Social Metatags
  * Both built by Brandon Weigel
  * Badges incorporates the old Altmetrics module, and will replace it after the 7.x-1.9 release is done
    * FSU wants to use Badges real bad (with some minor tweaks)
  * Social Metatags lives in Islandora-labs and adds extra meta tag info to the HMTL header of objects so they look pretty when linked on social media
    * Who doesn't want that?

## Next Meeting
* April 24, 2017 - 1pm EST
* Chair: Aaron Retteen
* Note Taker: Aaron Retteen
