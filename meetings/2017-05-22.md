    - Chris Day, School of the Art Institute of Chicago
  - CLAW seems functional, but a long way off from being usable for non-RDF folks
    - MODSpocalypse (conversion of MODS to RDF is an active discussion, also upcoming Working Group for this)
    - No solution to the problem of entering names into a submission form
      - Autocomplete for LOC/VIAF authorities?
      - What if they don't have an authority record? Should we mint a local URI?
      - Don suggested reading [Transitioning from XML to RDF by Juliet Hardesty](https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ital/article/download/9182/pdf)
  - Christina Harlow's workshop was awesome
    - Ontology rot seems scary though, we need to be careful what ontologies we pick for Scholar stuff
    - Bryan suggested investigating the [VIVO Ontology](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/Ontologies+in+VIVO)
- Don mentioned GitHub Marketplace as being a potentially useful way to integrate other services with
