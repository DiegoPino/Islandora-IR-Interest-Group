## Notes
- No agenda items, this meeting we can talk about anything members want to discuss.
- New JIRA ticket from Don: https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-2101
  - UTK uses numbered extra datastreams to handle supplemental files for an object
  - ~300ish datastreams seems to be the threshold for bug
  - Tested up to 1000
- Wilhelmina: How are people using DOIs?
  - Mark Jordanâ€™s DOI Framework module
  - Arca uses DOIs for repo objects
  - Commitment to maintenance not a huge issue
  - Main choice for DOIs is between CrossRef and DataCite 
    - DataCite Canada is free
    - Crossref is $275 annual fee (for nonprofit) + $1 per DOI
    - Also ARKs, HDLs, EZIDs. Whats the difference?
  - Kimberly used DOIs for undergrad research journals at a past institution
- Next scheduled meeting is November 23, which is American Thanksgiving. 
  - We should push the meeting back a week to November 30th.
