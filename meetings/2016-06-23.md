**Ticket for interest group on Integrating with Orchid<br/>**
* https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-IR-Interest-Group/issues/10

**Solar Embargo Issues:**
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora-ir/bvTMqbyXXZA

Mulgara: Embargos can be on an object or datastream. Pseudo Embargos.<br/>
Triple store possibly an issue if used something other than Mulgara. <br/>
Works currently but difficult to rationalize fixing if it currently “technically works”<br/>
This will be avoided in the CLAW version.<br/>
Batch update embargos could have issues.<br/>
There is some expressed interest in correcting this. <br/>

**Orcid Integration:**<br/>
Where is everyone’s at with Orcid? Implementation?<br/>
Interest in using ID to disambiguate authors<br/>
Analytics Dashboard for authors. <br/>
Revisit the issues tracker; Ideas and issues to post in the Github’s issue tracker<br/>

Also post on the Google Group<br/>
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora-ir/cEpfd_XQu1M<br/>

Integrating Islandora with external frameworks like OSF and Elements is the future<br/>
http://symplectic.co.uk/products/elements/

Scholar integrate with any external frameworks? Possibly only Datasite for DOIs<br/>

Where is CLAW with IR at this point?<br/>
Brian: 3000ft level<br/>
How is data model being structured? <br/>
Mostly uniform models<br/>
Building use cases and suggests anyone interested to submit a use case to the 7.x 2.x repo<br/>
Currently discussing what is an “IR” and what it should do.
